# bVerse

**bVerse** is a real-time conversational intelligence framework that transforms live audio streams into actionable insights. By integrating **speech detection**, **transcription**, **speaker diarization**, and **large language model (LLM) reasoning**, bVerse delivers contextually aware responses in multi-speaker environments. It serves as a bridge between human conversation and AI understanding, enhancing collaborative discussions, improving meeting productivity, and enabling interactive voice systems.
